# dotfiles
I haven't yet written a script to keep these files synced between my various systems, so I'm currently using [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) for that purpose.

They're still pretty basic currently as I'm still figuring out how best to customize and organize them (and I don't want to just copy someone else's file without understanding what it does).

They are free to use in whichever manner you wish.
